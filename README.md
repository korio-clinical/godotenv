A Go (golang) port of the Ruby [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) project (which loads env vars from a .env file).

From the original Library:

> Storing configuration in the environment is one of the tenets of a twelve-factor app. Anything that is likely to change between deployment environments–such as resource handles for databases or credentials for external services–should be extracted from the code into environment variables.
>
> But it is not always practical to set environment variables on development machines or continuous integration servers where multiple projects are run. Dotenv load variables from a .env file into ENV when the environment is bootstrapped.

It can be used as a library (for loading in env for your own daemons etc.) or as a bin command.

There is test coverage and CI for both linuxish and Windows environments, but I make no guarantees about the bin version working on Windows.

## Installation

As a library

```shell
go get github.com/korio-clinical/godotenv
```

or if you want to use it as a bin command

```shell
go install github.com/korio-clinical/godotenv/cmd/godotenv@latest
```

## Usage

Add your application configuration to your `.env` file in the root of your project:

```shell
S3_BUCKET=YOURS3BUCKET
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE
```

Then in your Go app you can do something like

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "os"

    "github.com/korio-clinical/godotenv"
)

func main() {
  err := godotenv.Load(NewMemMapFs())
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Error loading .env file")
  }

  s3Bucket := os.Getenv("S3_BUCKET")
  secretKey := os.Getenv("SECRET_KEY")

  // now do something with s3 or whatever
}
```

If you're even lazier than that, you can just take advantage of the autoload package which will read in `.env` on import

```go
import _ "github.com/korio-clinical/godotenv/autoload"
```

While `.env` in the project root is the default, you don't have to be constrained, both examples below are 100% legit

```go
godotenv.Load(afs, "somerandomfile")
godotenv.Load(afs, "filenumberone.env", "filenumbertwo.env")
```

If you want to be really fancy with your env file you can do comments and exports (below is a valid env file)

```shell
# I am a comment and that is OK
SOME_VAR=someval
FOO=BAR # comments at line end are OK too
export BAR=BAZ
```

Or finally you can do YAML(ish) style

```yaml
FOO: bar
BAR: baz
```

as a final aside, if you don't want godotenv munging your env you can just get a map back instead

```go
var myEnv map[string]string
myEnv, err := godotenv.Read(afs)

s3Bucket := myEnv["S3_BUCKET"]
```

... or from an `io.Reader` instead of a local file

```go
reader := getRemoteFile()
myEnv, err := godotenv.Parse(afs, reader)
```

... or from a `string` if you so desire

```go
content := getRemoteFileContent()
myEnv, err := godotenv.Unmarshal(afs, content)
```

### Precedence & Conventions

Existing envs take precedence of envs that are loaded later.

The [convention](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv#what-other-env-files-can-i-use)
for managing multiple environments (i.e. development, test, production)
is to create an env named `{YOURAPP}_ENV` and load envs in this order:

```go
env := os.Getenv("FOO_ENV")
if "" == env {
  env = "development"
}

godotenv.Load(afs, ".env." + env + ".local")
if "test" != env {
  godotenv.Load(afs, ".env.local")
}
godotenv.Load(afs, ".env." + env)
godotenv.Load(afs) // The Original .env
```

If you need to, you can also use `godotenv.Overload()` to defy this convention
and overwrite existing envs instead of only supplanting them. Use with caution.

### Command Mode

Assuming you've installed the command as above and you've got `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH`

```
godotenv -f /some/path/to/.env some_command with some args
```

If you don't specify `-f` it will fall back on the default of loading `.env` in `PWD`

By default, it won't override existing environment variables; you can do that with the `-o` flag.

### Writing Env Files

Godotenv can also write a map representing the environment to a correctly-formatted and escaped file

```go
env, err := godotenv.Unmarshal(afs, "KEY=value")
err := godotenv.Write(afs, env, "./.env")
```

... or to a string

```go
env, err := godotenv.Unmarshal(afs, "KEY=value")
content, err := godotenv.Marshal(afs, env)
```

## Releases

Releases should follow [Semver](http://semver.org/) though the first couple of releases are `v1` and `v1.1`.

## Who?

The original library [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) was written by [Brandon Keepers](http://opensoul.org/), and this port was done by [John Barton](https://johnbarton.co/) based off the tests/fixtures in the original library, then supports of in-memory filesystem via a minimal fs interface was brought by [James Light](https://github.com/jl2501)
